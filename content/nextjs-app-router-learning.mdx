summary: "My practical learnings from using the Next.js App Router in real projects."
---

Next.js App Router changed how I build React applications.

Earlier, routing felt separate from logic.  
Now, routing, layouts, and data fetching feel connected.

---

## What I Learned

The biggest shift was understanding **server vs client components**.

Not everything needs to run on the client.  
Moving logic to the server improved performance and code clarity.

---

## Layouts & Structure

Layouts helped me avoid repeated code.

Instead of wrapping components manually, layouts gave me:
- Cleaner folder structure
- Shared UI
- Better scalability

---

## Loading & Error Handling

Using `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` was a game changer.

Now users see instant feedback instead of blank screens.

---

## Final Thought

App Router feels more **production-ready**.

Once I understood the mental model, my apps became faster, cleaner, and easier to maintain.
