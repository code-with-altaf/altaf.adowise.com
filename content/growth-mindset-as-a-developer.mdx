title: "Growth and Mindset as a Developer"
publishedAt: "2025-02-26"
summary: "How my approach to learning and growth changed as I gained real development experience."
---

Early in my journey, I believed growth meant learning more tools and frameworks.

Over time, I realized that growth is less about speed and more about direction.

## Moving Away from Constant Tool Chasing

At one point, I tried to keep up with every new library and update.

It felt productive, but most of it didn’t stick.

What actually helped was slowing down and going deeper into:
- Core JavaScript concepts
- How browsers and servers work
- Why certain patterns exist

Depth brought clarity.

## Learning to Be Comfortable with Not Knowing

Earlier, not knowing something felt like a weakness.

Now, I see it as a normal part of development.

Being comfortable with uncertainty helped me:
- Ask better questions
- Read documentation patiently
- Debug without panic

Confidence came from problem-solving, not from memorization.

---

## Consistency Over Intensity

Short bursts of intense learning didn’t last.

Consistency did.

Writing code regularly, even in small amounts, created:
- Better intuition
- Faster debugging
- More thoughtful decisions

Progress became steady instead of chaotic.

---

## Feedback Over Validation

At one stage, external validation mattered a lot.

Over time, feedback mattered more.

Real feedback from:
- Bugs in production
- Code reviews
- Real users

These signals taught me more than praise ever could.

---

## Growth Through Responsibility

Taking ownership of features and systems changed how I worked.

When something broke, it was my responsibility to fix it.

That responsibility forced me to:
- Think long-term
- Write safer code
- Understand systems end to end

---

## What Growth Means to Me Now

Growth now feels quieter.

It looks like:
- Making fewer careless mistakes
- Designing simpler solutions
- Understanding trade-offs instead of chasing perfection

The mindset shifted from “learning everything” to “learning what matters”.

## Final Thought

Growth in development is not linear.

It’s shaped by mistakes, patience, and persistence.

The mindset you build determines how far you go, not just the skills you collect.
