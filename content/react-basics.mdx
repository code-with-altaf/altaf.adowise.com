When I started learning React, the biggest shift for me was realizing that UI is built from small reusable pieces instead of one large page.

At first, React felt confusing, but once the core concepts became clear, the overall approach started to make sense.

## Components: Building Blocks of UI

React is centered around components.

I learned to:
- Break the UI into small reusable components  
- Keep logic close to the UI it controls  
- Reuse the same component in multiple places  

This approach made my code cleaner, easier to read, and simpler to maintain as projects grew.

## Props: Passing Data Between Components

Props helped me understand how data flows in React applications.

Key takeaways:
- Data flows from parent components to child components  
- Props are read-only and should not be mutated  
- They help create flexible and reusable components  

Once props were clear, building dynamic and configurable components became much easier.

## State: Making UI Dynamic

State was a major turning point in my React learning journey.

With state, I could:
- Update the UI based on user interactions  
- Manage form values and UI toggles  
- Handle loading, success, and error states  

State explained how React reacts to changes and re-renders the UI efficiently.

## Key Lessons

- Think in terms of components  
- Keep state minimal and purposeful  
- Use props to pass data clearly  
- Prioritize readability and simplicity

## Final Thought

Learning the basics of React gave me a strong foundation.

Everything I build today, from dashboards to full-stack applications, is based on these fundamental React concepts.
