summary: "Mistakes every developer makes at least once, and what they actually teach you."

Every developer talks about tools, frameworks, and new features.  
Very few talk honestly about **mistakes**.

But most real learning comes from things going wrong.

This blog is about the common mistakes I made as a developer and what they taught me.

## Treating “Working Code” as Good Code

Early on, if something worked, I moved on.

I didn’t think about:
- Readability
- Maintainability
- Edge cases

Later, when features changed or bugs appeared, the same code became painful to work with.

I learned that code quality is not about today — it’s about tomorrow.

---

## Ignoring Fundamentals While Chasing Frameworks

I spent a lot of time learning frameworks without fully understanding:
- JavaScript internals
- HTTP and browser behavior
- Async flow

Frameworks made things easier, but debugging became harder.

Once I went back to fundamentals, everything started making more sense.

---

## Underestimating useEffect and State Logic

React felt simple until it didn’t.

Small mistakes in state or effects caused:
- Extra API calls
- Performance issues
- Unpredictable UI behavior

I learned that React hooks are powerful, but they demand precision and discipline.

---

## Treating Backend as Just “API Code”

At one point, I thought backend work was only about returning data.

I ignored:
- Data modeling
- Error handling
- Security
- Performance

As apps grew, backend issues started affecting everything.

That’s when I realized backend decisions shape the entire product.

## Not Taking Errors and Logs Seriously

For a long time, error handling felt optional.

In production, it isn’t.

Without proper logs:
- Bugs are invisible
- Fixes take longer
- Stress increases

I learned that logs are not noise — they are signals.

---

## Overengineering Too Early

Trying to design the “perfect system” from day one slowed me down.

I added complexity before it was needed.

Later, I understood that:
- Simplicity scales better
- Real requirements appear over time
- Flexibility matters more than perfection

---

## What These Mistakes Taught Me

- Shipping is important, but stability matters
- Clean code saves time in the long run
- Fundamentals never become outdated
- Mistakes are not failures, they are feedback

---

## Final Thought

Every experienced developer has a list of mistakes behind them.

What matters is not avoiding mistakes completely, but learning from them and not repeating them blindly.

Growth in development is less about speed and more about awareness.
