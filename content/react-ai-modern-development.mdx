React development is no longer just about UI.

With AI tools and APIs, React apps are becoming **smarter**, not just interactive.

---

## React + AI: What Changed for Me

Earlier, apps were mostly CRUD-based.

Now with AI:
- Apps can summarize content
- Generate text
- Answer user queries
- Automate workflows

React becomes the **interface for intelligence**.

---

## How I Use AI in React Apps

I mostly use AI through APIs.

Common patterns I learned:
- Call AI APIs from **server actions**
- Keep API keys secure on the server
- Stream responses for better UX

AI logic stays on backend, React handles experience.

---

## Streaming Responses Feel Magical

Instead of waiting for a full response, streaming text feels real-time.

This improved:
- User engagement
- Perceived performance
- App quality

---

## React Still Matters

AI doesn’t replace frontend skills.

Good AI apps still need:
- Clean UI
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Thoughtful UX

React is what makes AI usable.

## Final Thought

AI added a new dimension to React apps.

Now I think beyond forms and dashboards —  
I think about **assistance, automation, and intelligence**.
